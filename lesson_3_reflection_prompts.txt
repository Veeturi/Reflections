When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	1. When we are working on a differnt remporary system.
	2. When we want to save all our changes to an online drive.
	3. When we are experienceing unpredictable situations on our local computer which may render our data unsaved.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We may have made some changes to the online repository ahich we do not want to be reflected on the local repository hence, it is always better to do it manually.
